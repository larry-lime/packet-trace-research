DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     TTccppddpprriivv removes sensitive information from a packet trace, replacing it
     with contrived information from which the sensitive information cannot be
     reconstructed.  By removing the sensitive information, the output of
     ttccppddpprriivv may be shared with others (for debugging or network analysis,
     say).

     In general, data which is not otherwise processed by ttccppddpprriivv is deleted.
     For example, the data portion of a datagram is not included in the output
     file.

     When a header is changed, the checksum for that header is also updated to
     reflect the change in header data values.

     The various options provide different levels of privacy/security for dif-
     ferent portions of IP datagrams.  The numbers refer to the different lev-
     els of security -- in general, smaller numbers are more secure.

     The number zero (0) is the default for each of the options.  This pro-
     vides the most secure output file, but may delete information helpful to
     those interested in using the output.

     The number ninety-nine (99) generally means "release the information as
     is".  This level is available for IP unicast and multicast addresses,
     classness, TCP and IP options and TCP and UDP port numbers.

     The payload inside an IP protocol type 4 ("ipip" or "ip-encaps") datagram
     is assumed to be an encapsulated IP datagram and is transformed in the
     same manner as the outer (encapsulating) IP datagram.

     The second form is an example that protects IP address information, but
     releases TCP and UDP port numbers as well as retaining information about
     which packets were (IP-level) multicast packets.  This is a safe manner
     in which to run ttccppddpprriivv.

     --aa          Exit after _[_[_h_h_:_]_m_m_:_]_s_s time has expired.

     --AA          How IP addresses should be treated.  All-zeros and all-ones
                 addresses are never changed.  Level 0 maps different
                 addresses to integers (counting from 1).  Level 1 maps the
                 upper and lower 16 bits, separately, to integers (counting
                 from 1); the upper and lower maps are independent (so, the
                 address 128.130.128.130 may be mapped to something like
                 0.3.0.28, eg, with the upper and lower 16 bits having differ-
                 ent values).  Level 2 maps each byte of the address sepa-
                 rately (again, counting from 1); each byte map is indepen-
                 dent.

                 Level 50 is more complicated (though more useful in certain
                 situations).  With level 50, if two of the original addresses
                 were equal in the most significant N bits, then these two
                 addresses will map to private addresses that are similarly
                 equal in the most significant N bits.  (This feature can be
                 useful for using trace datasets to study the dynamics of var-
                 ious data structures for forwarding tables, for example.)

                 NOTE:  level 50 reveals more information about a site's local
                 network topology than the other levels.  This could be of
                 concern to some sites (but is probably not a concern for most
                 sites).  (The document 'Thoughts on How to Mount an Attack on
                 tcpdpriv's "-A50" Option...', included with the ttccppddpprriivv
                 source distribution, discusses some of the issues related to
                 level 50.)

                 Level 99 passes IP addresses through unchanged.

     --cc          Exit after receiving _c_o_u_n_t packets.

     --CC          How the "classness" of input and output IP addresses should
                 be related.  (In "classic IP", there was a notion of "class-
                 ness" associated with IP addresses; an IP address was class
                 A, class B, class C, or class D depending on the first most
                 significant bits of the IP header.)  Level 0 implies that no
                 class information is carried through.  Level 1 implies that
                 class A addresses are mapped into class A addresses; Level 2
                 implies that in addition, class B addresses are mapped into
                 class B addresses; Level 3 implies that in addition, class C
                 addresses are mapped into class C addresses; Level 4 implies
                 that in addition, class D addresses (multicast) are mapped
                 into class D addresses.

                 (In fact, the --CC flag actually preserves leading _o_n_e _(_1_)
                 bits; thus, level 32, for example, will map class A, B, C,
                 and D (respectively) addresses in to class A, B, C, and D
                 (respectively) addresses and will also map the all-ones IP
                 broadcast address into in an all-ones IP addresss.  Level 99
                 is a synonym for level 32.)

     --FF          Use _f_i_l_e as input for the filter expression.  An additional
                 expression given on the command line is ignored.

     --ii          Listen on _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e.  If unspecified, ttccppddpprriivv searches the
                 system interface list for the lowest numbered, configured up
                 interface (excluding loopback).

     --MM          How multicast addresses are mapped:  level 0 implies map
                 using the --AA and --CC option values; level 99 passes multicast
                 addresses through unchanged.  The rest of the levels relate
                 to the scoping of multicast datagrams: level 10 passes multi-
                 cast addresses in globally-scoped datagrams through
                 unchanged; level 20 passes multicast addresses in continent-
                 local datagrams through unchanged; level 70 passes multicast
                 addresses in site-local datagrams through unchanged; level 80
                 passes multicast addresses in link-local datagrams through
                 unchanged; level 90 passes multicast addresses in node-local
                 datagrams through unchanged.  (Note that in IPv4, "scoping"
                 is determined by TTL values.)

     --OO          Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer.  This is use-
                 ful only if you suspect a bug in the optimizer.

     --pp          Do not put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that
                 the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other
                 reason; hence, `-p' cannot be used as an abbreviation for
                 `ether host {localhost} or broadcast'.

     --PP          Set the mapping for both TCP and UDP port numbers.  Level 0
                 maps the 16-bit port numbers to a single integer (see the --AA
                 option above).  Level 1 maps each 8-bit byte in the port num-
                 ber to a single integer.

     --qq          Normally, ttccppddpprriivv logs its command-line parameters and a
                 summary at the end of execution to standard error.  The --qq
                 flag suppresses these messages.

     --rr          Read packets from _i_n_p_u_t_f_i_l_e (which was created with the -w
                 option of tcpdump(1) ). Standard input is used if _i_n_p_u_t_f_i_l_e
                 is ``-''.

     --ss          Snarf _s_n_a_p_l_e_n bytes of data from each packet rather than the
                 default of 88 (with NIT, the minimum is actually 96).  See
                 the tcpdump(1) man page for more information.

     --SS          How IP and TCP options should be treated.  Level 0 replaces
                 all options with NOPs (0x01, in both cases).  Level 1 leaves
                 all the options alone.

     --TT          Set the mapping for just the TCP port numbers.  See the --PP
                 option for details.

     --UU          Set the mapping for just the UDP port numbers.  See the --PP
                 option for details.

     --ww _o_u_t_p_u_t_f_i_l_e
                 Specifies the output file, which will look as if it had been
                 generated by the tcpdump(1) command, using its --ww option.  If
                 this argument is not provided, the output will be written to
                 standard output (which is not allowed to be a terminal
                 device).

     _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  selects which packets will be processed (packets not matching
                 _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n will be deleted).  See the tcpdump(1) man page for
                 details on the format of _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.

     Ylonen <tatu@ssh.com> for contributions and clarifications to the secu-
     rity aspects of ttccppddpprriivv.  Notwithstanding the help from these people,
     all bugs remain the responsibility of the author (but, see the disclaimer
     below).

     Portions of ttccppddpprriivv (and this man page) are extracted from tcpdump(1)

BBUUGGSS
     Link-level headers are passed through unchanged.

     Tcpdpriv should probably preserve the all-zeroes and all-ones addresses.

     It would be nice if ttccppddpprriivv could retain subnet broadcast information.

     TTccppddpprriivv supports only SLIP, PPP, Ethernet, FDDI, and the NULL data
     links.

     FDDI is only supported on systems that have the include file
     <netinet/if_fddi.h>.

     There should be some way to allow the various pre-defined multicast
     addresses (such as "all-nodes", etc.) to be passed through unchanged.

     There is a bug in tcpdump(1) which makes it unable to filter a 0.x.y.z
     address.  TTccppddpprriivv attempts to avoid generating addresses in this format.
     However, with "-A50", it is _p_o_s_s_i_b_l_e that ttccppddpprriivv will, in fact, gener-
     ate such an address.
