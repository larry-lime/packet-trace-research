<h1>
<em>TCPDPRIV</em>
</h1>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Description</b>
<dd>
<em>Tcpdpriv</em> is program for eliminating confidential information
from packets collected on a network interface (or,
from trace files created using the <b>-w</b> argument to
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z><em>tcpdump</em></a>).
<dt>
<b>Requirements</b>
<dd>
Tcpdpriv is fairly modest in its requirements.  It does, however,
require the <a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z><em>packet capture
library (libpcap)</em></a>.
<dt>
<b>Limitations</b>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Tcpdpriv</em> works on SunOS, Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux, and
should port to other systems fairly easily, although there
have been problems reported porting to Digital Unix running on Alpha
processors.
<li>
Link-level headers are passed through unchanged.
<li>
It would be nice if <em>tcpdpriv</em> could retain subnet
broadcast information.
<li>
The <i>-A50</i> option can be a security concern for some sites (but
is probably not a concern for most sites).  A short
<a href=attack50/attack50.html>analysis</a>
of the
security issues with the <i>-A50</i> option is available.
</ul>
