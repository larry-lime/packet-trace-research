Compilation on supported platforms should be simple if the required libraries
are present (see the README file).  After editing the makefile and
commenting/uncommenting the appropriate lines:

./make

should do the trick.  If it does not, please send an email to
<eblanton@cs.ohiou.edu> detailing the errors generated and a short description
of the system you tried to compile it on.  Please note that the only currently
supported systems are Linux 2.2.x, Linux 2.4.x, and Solaris 7.x.

Note that building has only been tested with the GNU gcc compiler, but it
should compile with any ANSI C compiler.

Installation is as simple as copying the generated 'tcpurify' executable to
the location of your choice, such as /usr/local/bin.
